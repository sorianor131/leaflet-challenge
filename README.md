Module 15 Homework Assignment - LeafLet Challenge

## Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
For part one of this challenge we were tasked with visualizing an earthquake dataset. 

1. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) page and choose a dataset to visualize. 

2. Import and visualize the data by doing the following:
    * Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude. 

    * Your data markers should reflect the magnitued of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 

    * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when it's associated marker is clicked. 

    * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
